In computing, a bottleneck can refer to a slow or limited component that restricts the overall performance of a system. For example, a slow hard drive can be a bottleneck in a computer system, as it limits the speed at which data can be read and written, even if other components, such as the CPU and memory, are faster. In a broader sense, the term \"bottleneck\" can be used to describe any constraint that limits the ability of a system to perform at its desired level.\n",
